## Abstract

This document presents **Vectras VM**, an open-source virtual machine application engineered for the Android mobile operating system. The project leverages the Quick Emulator (QEMU) framework to enable full-system emulation of diverse operating systems—including Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux distributions, Apple macOS, and Android—on mobile devices equipped with modern ARM and x86 processors.

### Background

The proliferation of high-performance mobile processors has created an opportunity for system-level virtualization on handheld devices. Contemporary mobile System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, particularly those based on ARM Cortex-A and Qualcomm Kryo architectures, now deliver computational throughput comparable to desktop processors from the previous decade. This hardware evolution enables complex workloads, including full operating system emulation, to execute with acceptable performance on mobile platforms.

### Objectives

The Vectras VM project addresses the following technical objectives:

1. **Cross-Platform Emulation**: Enable execution of operating systems designed for x86, x86_64, ARM, and ARM64 architectures on Android host devices
2. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize emulation overhead through efficient binary translation and hardware utilization
3. **User Accessibility**: Provide an intuitive interface for creating, configuring, and managing virtual machine instances
4. **Hardware Support**: Enable emulated 3D graphics acceleration through 3Dfx Glide wrapper integration
5. **System Integrity**: Implement experimental deterministic processing frameworks for enhanced reliability

### Architecture

The system architecture comprises several interconnected subsystems:

**Core Emulation Layer**: Built upon QEMU 9.2.x with custom patches for Android compatibility and 3Dfx hardware emulation support. The emulation layer implements dynamic binary translation to convert guest instruction streams to host-native code at runtime.

**Android Application Layer**: A native Android application written in Java and Kotlin, providing the user interface, virtual machine management, and integration with Android system services including storage, networking, and power management.

**Bootstrap Environment**: An Alpine Linux-based userspace environment executing within PRoot, providing the necessary GNU/Linux libraries and tools for QEMU execution without requiring root privileges.

**Vectra Core Framework** (Experimental): A novel information-theoretic runtime subsystem implementing deterministic event processing with 4-phase cycle loops, 2-of-3 consensus mechanisms, and append-only evidence logging.

### Methodology

The implementation follows an iterative development methodology incorporating:

- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns between emulation, interface, and support subsystems
- **Platform Abstraction**: Architecture-specific optimizations for ARM64, ARM32, x86_64, and x86 host platforms
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated build processes with continuous integration testing
- **Community Development**: Open-source contribution model with public issue tracking and code review

### Technical Contributions

The project introduces several technical contributions to the mobile virtualization domain:

1. **Android-QEMU Integration**: Methodologies for integrating QEMU within the Android application sandbox, including file system abstraction and process management

2. **3Dfx Emulation Pipeline**: Implementation of Glide API emulation enabling legacy 3D applications to render within the emulated environment

3. **Vectra Core MVP**: A proof-of-concept framework demonstrating:
   - 1024-bit state flags for system state tracking
   - 4×4 parity blocks with 8-bit error detection
   - CRC32C-based integrity verification
   - Priority-based event processing at 10 Hz
   - CPU/RAM/DISK triad consensus for fault detection
   - Append-only binary logging for forensic analysis

4. **Multi-Architecture Support**: Build configurations supporting four distinct Android CPU architectures from a single codebase

### Results

The Vectras VM application demonstrates the viability of full-system emulation on mobile devices:

- **Compatibility**: Successful emulation of Windows (3.1 through 11), various Linux distributions, macOS (via OSK bypass), and nested Android instances
- **Performance**: Acceptable responsiveness for interactive workloads on devices with Snapdragon 855 or equivalent processors
- **Stability**: Robust operation across supported device manufacturers including Samsung, Google, Xiaomi, and ZTE
- **Adoption**: Significant community adoption as evidenced by GitHub star metrics and active community channels

### Conclusions

Vectras VM establishes a foundation for mobile virtualization research and practical applications. The project demonstrates that modern mobile hardware can support complex emulation workloads, opening opportunities in education, development, and legacy system preservation.

Future development directions include:

- Enhanced performance through native code generation optimizations
- Extended hardware passthrough capabilities
- Integration of the Vectra Core framework into production builds
- Support for emerging ARM architectural extensions (SVE, SME)

### Significance

The significance of this work extends across multiple domains:

**Educational**: Enables students and researchers to explore operating system concepts without dedicated hardware
**Professional**: Supports software development and testing workflows on mobile devices
**Archival**: Facilitates preservation and execution of legacy software systems
**Research**: Provides a platform for virtualization and emulation research on ARM architectures
